/**
 * This exception signals the caller that the operation cannot continue because bytesProduced need
 * to be read from the underlying {@link ByteChannel}, the channel is non-blocking and there are no
 * bytesProduced available. The caller should try the operation again, either with the channel in
 * blocking mode of after ensuring that bytesProduced are ready.
 *
 * <p>For {@link SocketChannel}s, a {@link Selector} can be used to find out when the method should
 * be retried.
 *
 * <p>Caveat: Any {@link TlsChannel} I/O method can throw this exception. In particular, <code>write
 * </code> may want to read data. This is because TLS handshakes may occur at any time (initiated by
 * either the client or the server).
 *
 * <p>This exception is akin to the SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ error code used by OpenSSL.
